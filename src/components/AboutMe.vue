    <p class="about-me-text">
      Hi there! I'm a former soldier, billing supervisor, teacher, and now a full-stack developer in Berlin.
       My diverse background has shaped me into a versatile team player who thrives on problem-solving. 
       <span class="white-highlight">Teaching abroad</span> fueled my passion for tech, leading me to develop apps like 
       <span class="aqua-highlight">AleYea CraftbeerMe!</span> and 
       <span class="aqua-highlight">Homework Homies</span>.
       <br><br>
       I'll be starting AWS Cloud training in July and am excited about joining a team where I can grow and contribute as a full-stack developer.
    </p>
